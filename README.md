# SLE
This library contains different methods of SLAE solutions: iteration methods, projection methods. 
## SRC
Folder containing headers ".hpp" in which methods are implemented.
## TESTS
Folder containing ".cpp" files - tests of implemented methods. For this I use google-test.
## CURRENT WORK
GMRES:  
Hessenberg Matrix, Givens rotations, Gauss reverse algorythm, GMRES algorythm  
  
Second test:  
Graphics  
  
Iteration methods:  
GS, SGS, iterations for them.
